1,Junior Data Scientist / Junior Software Developer,SynergisticIT,"Boston, MA",via LinkedIn,"2024 is almost over and we hope the Job market improves . Almost 600,000 tech employees have been laid off since 2022 and it’s still ongoing. The effect of this has led hundreds of thousands of laid off Tech employees competing with existing Jobseekers.

Entry level Job seekers struggle to get responses to their applications, are getting ghosted after interviews. In such a scenario the Job seekers need to differentiate themselves by ensuring to obtain exceptional skills and technologies so that they can wear multiple roles at a client as clients now would want to expand roles and responsibilities assigned to a particular job to save costs.

Since 2010 Synergisticit has helped Jobseekers differentiate themselves by providing candidates the requisite skills and experience to outperform at interviews and clients. Here at SynergisticIT We just don’t focus on getting you a Job we make careers.

All Positions are open for all visas and US citizens

We are matchmakers we provide clients with candidates who can perform from day 1 of starting work. In this challenging economy every client wants to save $$$’s and they want the best value for their money. Jobseekers need to self-evaluate if they have the requisite skills to meet client requirements and needs as Clients now post covid can also hire remote workers which increases even more competition for jobseekers.

We at Synergisticit understand the problem of the mismatch between employer's requirements and Employee skills and that's why since 2010 we have helped 1000’s of candidates get jobs at technology clients like apple, google, Paypal, western union, bank of america, visa, walmart labs etc to name a few.

We have an excellent reputation with the clients. Currently, We are looking for entry-level software programmers, Java Full stack developers, Python/Java developers, Data analysts/ Data Scientists, Machine Learning engineers for full time positions with clients.

Roku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension). Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter.

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams.

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

What You'll Do:
• Design and implement new solutions that will help every Datadog engineer collaborate and ship new code to our production systems
• Be the owner of some of the critical developer workflows at Datadog (mege queue, change detection, bundle release...)
• Meet directly with your customer base to understand their needs

Who You Are:
• A seasoned engineer with 5+ years of software development experience
• Someone that is keen on improving developer's workflows

• Someone that has at least one experience in designing CI workflows using commercial tooling (Gitlab, Jenkins, CircleCI...)
• Someone that enjoys mentoring other engineers
• Someone that enjoys working with other teams across the company

This job is available in various departments within our company; to conform to US export control regulations, some of these roles may require candidates to be eligible for any required authorizations from the US government.
Datadog values people from all walks of life. We understand not everyone will meet all the above qualifications on day one. That's okay. If you're passionate about technology and want to grow your skills, we encourage you to apply.

Description

As a senior front-end developer, work with ~50 copywriters, digital marketers, graphic designers, videographers, front-end developers, and programmers to fulfill our mission: Improving the Economy One Business at a Time™ with Profit Generating Websites™. Go capitalism! 🦅 🗽 Our team also has server admins and a few onsite technicians who double as in-house IT. See photos of the team. We grew up on a lot of direct-with-proprietor small business relationships back before website marketing was even a thing. Now a full-service marketing agency, we place more radio and podcast ads than anyone in Wisconsin. As our clients continue to grow, we now collaborate with robust and digitally literate in-house teams. The next phase in our growth is all about ownership mindset and culture fit. That means you: a self-starter who loves interacting daily with successful clients and colleagues. You take feedback well and can give it back, candidly and respectfully. Ideal candidates love responsibility and self-management (no babysitting!). That means you want to own the outcomes: you will be expected to troubleshoot, improvise, and often make decisions on your own about overcoming issues - not passing the buck to someone else!","[{'title': 'Qualifications', 'items': ['You have a positive attitude and meticulous attention to detail', 'You can write HTML & SCSS code from scratch, specifically HTML5/CSS3 and SCSS and beyond', 'You have experience working with Adobe photoshop- exporting imagery and using Photoshop to help replicate flat design mockups into working websites', 'You have extensive knowledge of website design standards, layout and typography as well as current trends and technologies', 'You have strong web/graphic design and JavaScript/JQuery skills', 'You’re comfortable with JQuery, C# and other .NET programming', 'You’re familiar with Microsoft Visual Studio and ASP', 'NET MVC Framework, especially MVC 4/5', 'You can navigate and update 3rd party content management systems', 'That means you: a self-starter who loves interacting daily with successful clients and colleagues', 'You take feedback well and can give it back, candidly and respectfully', 'Ideal candidates love responsibility and self-management (no babysitting!)', 'That means you want to own the outcomes: you will be expected to troubleshoot, improvise, and often make decisions on your own about overcoming issues - not passing the buck to someone else!']}, {'title': 'Benefits', 'items': ['Paid time off', 'Voluntary OT (@time-and-a-half pay)', 'Health insurance', 'Dental insurance', 'HSA option', 'Paid half-hour lunch (8 hours work = 8 hours pay)', 'Corporate sponsored Lifetime Fitness membership', 'Local small-batch coffee on tap', 'Be your own boss', 'Interact with successful business owners', 'A family-first company']}, {'title': 'Responsibilities', 'items': ['Style client websites to be on-brand, visually appealing, and easy to navigate', 'Troubleshoot site issues', 'Handle multiple projects and deadlines under pressure', 'Collaborate with development team and Project Manager + programming and design teams to ensure project success']}]","['2 days ago', '35–50 an hour', 'Full-time', 'No degree mentioned', 'Dental insurance', 'Health insurance', 'Paid time off']",https://www.inet-web.com/Jobs/senior-front-end-developer?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic,"[{'link': 'https://www.inet-web.com/Jobs/senior-front-end-developer?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic', 'source': 'INET-WEB'}, {'link': 'https://www.salary.com/job/inet-web/senior-front-end-developer/j202404050514269542520?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic', 'source': 'Salary.com'}, {'link': 'https://jobs.jopilot.net/job/SY0ItpMB_CyF9o_01jua1124?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic', 'source': 'JoPilot'}]",https://www.google.com/search?ibp=htl;jobs&q=Web+Developer&htidocid=vTylso1dIBVFWkItAAAAAA%3D%3D&hl=en-US&shndl=37&shmd=H4sIAAAAAAAA_xXKsQrCMBAAUFz7BeJ0s9hGBRe7WkUHF4WOJYlHEo13IRel3-BXq8ubXvWZVKsLUuAM-8xU6o5usMM3Rk6YoYYTGxDU2XpgggOzizhrfSlJtkqJxMZJ0SXYxvJTMaHhUd3ZyJ9BvM6Yoi44rDfLsUnk5tNw7q51jwYCQa9fD_ytBfTHLwLcqDGNAAAA&shmds=v1_AUFQtOPHpSJu-0q1qwfBQ0t4LRsMkt68ZCPNzqslpQhskx9chw&source=sh/x/job/li/m1/1#fpstate=tldetail&htivrt=jobs&htiq=Web+Developer&htidocid=vTylso1dIBVFWkItAAAAAA%3D%3D,"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAADgAAAA4CAMAAACfWMssAAAAV1BMVEUAAAD////R0dHU1NSdnZ2rq6u1tbWSkpKHh4fFxcXX19egoKCnp6f29vb7+/u5ubmBgYFYWFh5eXng4OBsbGw/Pz/t7e1lZWUeHh5TU1Pm5uYxMTFOTk4Rp29eAAAAz0lEQVRIie2T2Q6DIBBFWQTZXKpUu/3/dxaQRrTYIs+cRCejc5LhJgBQKBQK2fQC04tAgvl+ECgKrneihHDU0HBd+hoeQI/E6aQ4K8WcCLtQbBXxqMm0pg47UVNK0TKsA7FZJ+zfSDgy2OYWFXFcrLwkzDPmiIPdSK5n5I7uv8iAfd93qTYp4uwGM0RATOHMr0odJEkED1Px2XCs+NzumC6CPlcE/CO2UlmqVBE0m1B/pSq34utbFHGxXy6u0L6vcXh9uflCMBIRsVAoFE7wBlpmB6vgugHnAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC",2 days ago,35–50 an hour,Full-time,True,True,True,True,

In addition to a great team of more than 10,000 friendly colleagues and over 770 different job profiles, we offer experienced professionals and newcomers many attractive challenges that modern insurance companies face: Will the car of the future cause fewer accidents? What will retirement provision look like when everyone reaches the age of 100? We deal with the questions of tomorrow - for needs-based insurance for our more than 12 million customers - at our headquarters in Coburg in Upper Franconia and at our 38 branch offices in the office and in the field.

• Conducting training on the methods and tools used
• Implementing customer requirements that support customers in their work when using the internal tools
• Monitoring the market for current developments and innovations in the software development process
Profile

Our benefits
• Flexible working: For us, flexible working means that you can adapt your working hours to suit your circumstances. There are no core or minimum working hours with us. Instead, you perform your workload within a defined working time frame - adapted to local requirements if necessary. Thanks to mobile working, you can even work up to half of your monthly working hours from home or on the road under certain conditions.
• Family-friendly working: We place great importance on achieving an optimal work-life balance. For us, this includes support with childcare, vacation care and caring for relatives, as well as the opportunity to take on a part-time management position. We have been recognized as a family-friendly employer by the berufundfamilie audit since 2007.
• Results-oriented remuneration: In addition to your twelve monthly salaries, you will receive two collectively agreed special payments each year. And to make performance worthwhile, you will participate in a performance and results-oriented remuneration scheme, with the opportunity to receive more than one additional monthly salary. Your many years of loyalty to the company will also pay off: you will receive an anniversary payment, staggered according to your length of service.
• Lifelong learning: If you are working on the future, you must not stand still in the past. To ensure that you are always up to date, we support your professional development measures - both internally and externally. However, the focus of our training measures is not only on acquiring company or job-specific qualifications, but also on the private promotion of individually desired skills - e.g. language courses, driver safety training and much more.
• Healthy working: Keep fit and healthy. We support you with free sports activities at our company sports facilities or a subsidy for your gym membership. Particularly active employees can take part in various HUK sports groups in their free time: e.g. running, biking or team sports such as soccer or basketball. Or learn how to integrate a healthy lifestyle into your everyday life, both professionally and privately, in lectures and seminars. And because health is also about nutrition, you can enjoy healthy and handmade delicacies in our coffee bars or the company restaurant.

6,"Sr. Manager, Cyber Risk & Analysis",Capital One,"Richmond, VA (+2 others)",via Capital One Careers,"Sr. Manager, Cyber Risk & Analysis

Capital One is one of the fastest growing organizations in the world today, powered by our passion for our customers. We are serious about technology, we dream big, and we execute: Capital One moved our entire enterprise to the public cloud over the course of five years. Just as we prioritize driving innovation through technology, we equally prioritize cybersecurity, reliability, and managing technology risk.

For years, the cybersecurity community has debated whether the CISO should report to the CIO or not. In regulated financial services, the answer is: both. The first-line CISO has operational responsibilities and reports to the CIO. The second-line Chief Tech Risk Officer (CTRO) and the Technology Risk Management (TRM) organization have broader responsibilities for cybersecurity but also reliability, software quality, resilience, and other technology risks. The CTRO is independent, reports to the Chief Risk Officer, and oversees the work of the CISO and the CIO.

Technology Risk Management (TRM) is a small organization that packs a big punch. The ~100 professionals in TRM are trusted experts who oversee ~14,000 developers at Capital One. We raise the bar for excellence in cybersecurity, reliability, and tech risk. We shape strategy and decisions, challenge activities to ensure they meet our standards, and perform independent tests of our security and technology risk.

Our business leaders must make technology decisions constantly. TRM makes sure they have the tech risk information they need to make good decisions. Associates within TRM are highly-skilled information security, cybersecurity, site reliability engineering, technology, and risk management professionals. They have a wealth of experience and a demonstrated ability to add value with their advice and to deliver high-impact results.

This position, Sr. Manager, Technology & Cyber Risk Advisor, will play a key role in the organization’s second line of defense risk identification program by independently overseeing the organization’s cybersecurity and technology risk taking and providing expertise and challenge during ongoing assessments.

As part of the second line of defense, you will collaborate closely with partners in cybersecurity, technology, the lines of business, and other risk management offices across the various lines of business, to perform and support evaluations of the firm’s risk posture and offer independent advice and value-add recommendations regarding ways to reduce cybersecurity and technology risks. Having the ability to understand and translate data-driven analysis, business drivers, initiatives, and priorities, and translate them into meaningful risk analysis is critical to being a trusted advisor to our business stakeholders and partners.

Desired Outcomes:
• Be a trusted advisor and subject matter expert in your assigned Lines of Business
• Guide/drive effective and relevant risk conversations with Line of Business leadership and their teams to enable meaningful insights into key technology and cybersecurity risks (e.g., aligning to or providing insights in support of strategic priorities or objectives for the business, increasing risk accountability and visibility)
• Perform the review and effective challenge of technology and cybersecurity risks through business-driven assessment activities (e.g., risk and control self assessment (RCSA) activities, scenario analysis, new products and services, etc.), to include providing expertise and advice on risk themes and mitigation strategies
• Monitor, report, and escalate metric performance, identify changes or trends in the risk profile, and brief senior management
• Collaborate effectively and build trusted relationships with colleagues, stakeholders, and leaders across multiple organizations to achieve objectives.
• Communicate in a compelling manner, with a strong point of view, to any audience, including internal and external stakeholders
• Leverage business and tech/cyber domain expertise to raise the level of challenge activities to a strategic focus
• Constructively debate issues and connect the dots across various assessments (examples include assessments of new initiatives, scenario analysis, challenge of proposed mitigation plans and risk acceptances, etc.)
• Partner with first and second line peers to succinctly frame and report on technology and cybersecurity risks relative to risk appetite
• Identify opportunities to influence risk-taking strategies and ensure that aggregate risk is understood
• Introduce forward-looking risk measures that are relevant to the Lines of Business
• Operate a continuous improvement approach by reviewing and challenging the design and operation of processes
• Mentor more junior members of the team

A strong candidate:
• Has a strong foundation, passion, and proficiency in cybersecurity, technology, and risk management, industry, and regulatory trends
• Is intellectually curious and stays current on emerging cyber threats, technologies, and potential implications for the company.
• Has a team-first attitude and is comfortable building relationships and collaborating with the team and other partners and stakeholders to get the work done.
• Is execution oriented, a self-motivator in an ambiguous environment, can manage multiple projects while maintaining superior results, can successfully work in a fast-paced environment, and is able to quickly come up to speed with the business and technology environments with which they will be working.
• Demonstrates strong judgment to balance being both a trusted advisor to the business and driving effective challenge
• Encourages your business partners to balance trade-offs between risk and returns in order to achieve business objectives
• Has excellent verbal and written communication skills (tailored to the audience) and can concisely and logically explain complex/technical topics.
• Stays current on emerging cyber threats and potential implications to the firm

Basic Qualifications:
• Bachelor’s degree or military experience
• At least 6 years of experience managing, consulting, auditing, or at least 6 years of experience working in the fields of information security, technology, or risk management
• At least 5 years of experience developing, evaluating, or implementing cybersecurity, technology or risk assessment
• Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), Certified Information Security Manager (CISM), Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA), Certified Risk & Information Systems Control (CRISC), or Open FAIR Certified

Preferred Qualifications:
• Master’s degree
• At least 5 years of experience in a second-line or oversight role at a financial institution or regulatory agency
• Experience with scenario-based risk analysis methodologies or risk quantification techniques
• Experience working in an Agile environment

Job Description:

(Please Note: This is a 100% remote position that requires residence in the United States.)

We're looking for machine learning engineers with a background in natural language processing. Candidates with expertise in any of the following areas are highly desirable:
• Natural language understanding
• Dialog state tracking
• Natural language generation
• Speech-to-text & text-to-speech algorithms
• Strategies for optimizing and deploying transformer networks on embedded devices

As a company co-founded and led by engineers, we are focused on developer experience. We promise to minimize distractions (read: meetings) and to provide tools which maximize productivity. We are also committed to providing competitive total compensation, including profit sharing.

What You'll Do:

We are a small company, so you can expect to be an integral part of all phases of product development. Including lots and lots of flight testing. Here are a few examples of how you’ll contribute to the development of our tactical AI assistant, Scipio:
• Improve the robustness of our offline speech-to-text engine so it can operate in extremely cluttered environments.
• Infer drone operator's intent and integrate with our AI decision making and platform/sensor control engines.
• Support the design and implementation of our upcoming tactical dialog state tracking system.

About You:

There are no educational requirements. We're more interested in projects you've worked on - both on the job and on the side. So please be prepared to discuss those! The ideal candidate will have excellent Python skills and be adept in at least one ML framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.).

Application Process:

We have a two-stage interview process.

The first stage is a screener which is a combination of technical discussion about relevant engineering concepts as well as your past experience. This screener is generally around 30 minutes.

After the screener, if both sides believe it makes sense, we will provide you with an 'offline' coding test. This test is done on your own time, at your own pace, so you do not feel the pressure of coding live with us watching. We want you to do your best with a clear mind and free of interview jitters. The questions are a combination of algorithm and system design. Once you complete the test, we'll all hop back on another call and you will walk us through your code. We are not just looking for the right answers, we're interested in your thought processes and technical approach.

We are committed to a low-stress interview experience and promise there will be no trick questions or brain teasers!","[{'title': 'Qualifications', 'items': ['Natural language understanding', 'Dialog state tracking', 'Natural language generation', 'Speech-to-text & text-to-speech algorithms', 'Strategies for optimizing and deploying transformer networks on embedded devices', 'Including lots and lots of flight testing', 'There are no educational requirements', ""We're more interested in projects you've worked on - both on the job and on the side"", 'So please be prepared to discuss those!', 'The ideal candidate will have excellent Python skills and be adept in at least one ML framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.)', 'This screener is generally around 30 minutes']}, {'title': 'Benefits', 'items': ['We are also committed to providing competitive total compensation, including profit sharing']}, {'title': 'Responsibilities', 'items': ['We are a small company, so you can expect to be an integral part of all phases of product development', 'Improve the robustness of our offline speech-to-text engine so it can operate in extremely cluttered environments', ""Infer drone operator's intent and integrate with our AI decision making and platform/sensor control engines"", 'Support the design and implementation of our upcoming tactical dialog state tracking system']}]","['122K–256K a year', 'Full-time']",https://www.karkidi.com/job-details/46747-machine-learning-engineer-natural-language-processing-job?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic,"[{'link': 'https://www.karkidi.com/job-details/46747-machine-learning-engineer-natural-language-processing-job?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic', 'source': 'Karkidi'}]",https://www.google.com/search?ibp=htl;jobs&q=Natural+Language+Processing+Engineer&htidocid=ukbUeeYrap9Uph_oAAAAAA%3D%3D&hl=en-US&shndl=37&shmd=H4sIAAAAAAAA_x2NsQrCQBBEsc0nWG0tmhPBJpYiiiTBwl4253J3kuyG24vmq_xGE5uBgTdvsu8iqyq0PjBBSRg5sIMTu6lTLKDGNERsoUR2AzqCWxRLqjO1gas0oNPIehCGs4hraXnwKfVaGKPa5k4TpmBzK50RpkZG85JG53iox0h9i4keu_12zHt2q8kfOonP8P9sFAJDTR-44Jt4Dcf7DzQAEVaxAAAA&shmds=v1_AUFQtOPT063EtMZuwgrMkQCzj7PsDWsRxGeLkeKej1zNoA53Cg&source=sh/x/job/li/m1/1#fpstate=tldetail&htivrt=jobs&htiq=Natural+Language+Processing+Engineer&htidocid=ukbUeeYrap9Uph_oAAAAAA%3D%3D,"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",,122K–256K a year,Full-time,,,,,

1,Assistant Professor of Design: Interaction Design,Design Observer,"St. Louis, MO",via LinkedIn,"The College of Art in the Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position at the rank of assistant professor in Interaction Design. We are looking for a promising designer who seeks to develop their own creative practice within a collaborative school of design and art, all within the context of a Research-1 university. Our faculty work with undergraduate and graduate students in human-computer interaction, interaction design, graphic design, social design, and illustration. We anticipate many opportunities ahead to build and reshape curricula.

We are interested in candidates whose research aims to shape how people interact with contemporary and emerging technologies. Projects could include websites, apps, games, interfaces, wearables, immersive environments, and more. Creative practices might be organized in other ways—for example, around sustainability, medicine, public health, and urban technology. We embrace many forms of research, including scholarly, collaborative, client-driven, or self-generated. Overall, we seek people who build critical inquiry and a strong sense of craft and methodology into their design practice. Candidates should demonstrate capacity for excellence in teaching.

Our new colleague will conduct research, teach five courses per academic year, advise students, and provide service to the School, University, and profession. A terminal degree in design or a related field is required. Rank and salary for the position is commensurate with experience. The appointment begins August 2025. For fullest consideration, apply by January 6, 2025.

Our new faculty member will teach in the undergraduate communication design program. We offer BA and BFA Degrees in Communication Design, with the option to concentrate in Interaction Design, and a minor in Human-Computer Interaction—jointly offered with the McKelvey School of Engineering. This minor is projected to grow into a forthcoming major.

The successful candidate will also join a core group of faculty at the intersection of design, technological innovation, and social impact in the recently launched Master of Design (MDes) for HCI and Emerging Technology aiming to produce the next generation of design leaders and socially innovative digital products. The program’s first cohort enrolls in the fall of 2025. It is offered in partnership with the McKelvey School of Engineering, the School of Arts & Sciences, and the Skandalaris Center for Interdisciplinary Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Expected expanded partnerships include the College of Medicine, the Brown School of Social Work, and the forthcoming School of Public Health. The MDes program will ultimately reside in the planned Design Futures Hub in Weil Hall and is projected to be a significant component of both the Sam Fox School and the broader university’s strategic plan to make WashU an intersection for digital transformation, social innovation, and global impact.

Housed in the College of Art, these programs also collaborate with Illustration, Graphic Design, Studio Arts, and Fashion Design. Faculty across these programs are collaborative, energetic, accomplished, and community-centric. We are a group of designers, illustrators, and historians who prioritize artifact and human-centered design pedagogies; write in scholarly, critical, and expressive forms; design socially engaged processes; design human-computer interaction; and study the history and culture of design. Specific areas of expertise include user experience and interface design, typography, data visualization, socially-engaged design, brand identity, motion graphics, design research and image-making including children’s books and editorial illustration.

Undergraduate design majors mix gateway courses like Typography, Interaction Foundations, and Word and Image with specialized electives and concluding capstones to construct their specialties and portfolios. Our undergraduate minor in Creative Practice for Social Change builds on a partnership with the Brown School of Social Work. Across all our programs, Communication Design faculty teach in team and individual settings, simultaneously reinforcing their research and seeding collaboration.

Design faculty have access to ample university resources across the University to conduct their work including the Kranzberg Studio for the Illustrated Book (with letterpress and risograph), University Library Special Collections, and the Dowd Illustration Research Archive (DIRA), that features illustration holdings, rare books, and print history collections. The School and University also host conferences, forums, and funding opportunities for faculty in a variety of formats.

9,"Sr. Manager, Cyber Risk & Analysis",Capital One,"Richmond, VA (+2 others)",via Capital One Careers,"Sr. Manager, Cyber Risk & Analysis

Capital One is one of the fastest growing organizations in the world today, powered by our passion for our customers. We are serious about technology, we dream big, and we execute: Capital One moved our entire enterprise to the public cloud over the course of five years. Just as we prioritize driving innovation through technology, we equally prioritize cybersecurity, reliability, and managing technology risk.

For years, the cybersecurity community has debated whether the CISO should report to the CIO or not. In regulated financial services, the answer is: both. The first-line CISO has operational responsibilities and reports to the CIO. The second-line Chief Tech Risk Officer (CTRO) and the Technology Risk Management (TRM) organization have broader responsibilities for cybersecurity but also reliability, software quality, resilience, and other technology risks. The CTRO is independent, reports to the Chief Risk Officer, and oversees the work of the CISO and the CIO.

Technology Risk Management (TRM) is a small organization that packs a big punch. The ~100 professionals in TRM are trusted experts who oversee ~14,000 developers at Capital One. We raise the bar for excellence in cybersecurity, reliability, and tech risk. We shape strategy and decisions, challenge activities to ensure they meet our standards, and perform independent tests of our security and technology risk.

Our business leaders must make technology decisions constantly. TRM makes sure they have the tech risk information they need to make good decisions. Associates within TRM are highly-skilled information security, cybersecurity, site reliability engineering, technology, and risk management professionals. They have a wealth of experience and a demonstrated ability to add value with their advice and to deliver high-impact results.

This position, Sr. Manager, Technology & Cyber Risk Advisor, will play a key role in the organization’s second line of defense risk identification program by independently overseeing the organization’s cybersecurity and technology risk taking and providing expertise and challenge during ongoing assessments.

As part of the second line of defense, you will collaborate closely with partners in cybersecurity, technology, the lines of business, and other risk management offices across the various lines of business, to perform and support evaluations of the firm’s risk posture and offer independent advice and value-add recommendations regarding ways to reduce cybersecurity and technology risks. Having the ability to understand and translate data-driven analysis, business drivers, initiatives, and priorities, and translate them into meaningful risk analysis is critical to being a trusted advisor to our business stakeholders and partners.

Desired Outcomes:
• Be a trusted advisor and subject matter expert in your assigned Lines of Business
• Guide/drive effective and relevant risk conversations with Line of Business leadership and their teams to enable meaningful insights into key technology and cybersecurity risks (e.g., aligning to or providing insights in support of strategic priorities or objectives for the business, increasing risk accountability and visibility)
• Perform the review and effective challenge of technology and cybersecurity risks through business-driven assessment activities (e.g., risk and control self assessment (RCSA) activities, scenario analysis, new products and services, etc.), to include providing expertise and advice on risk themes and mitigation strategies
• Monitor, report, and escalate metric performance, identify changes or trends in the risk profile, and brief senior management
• Collaborate effectively and build trusted relationships with colleagues, stakeholders, and leaders across multiple organizations to achieve objectives.
• Communicate in a compelling manner, with a strong point of view, to any audience, including internal and external stakeholders
